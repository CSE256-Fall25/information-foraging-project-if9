      <h1>Parent-Staff Communication</h1>
      <p>
        Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website, and emails provide information on current themes, 
        activities, and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails from classroom teachers to discuss your childâ€™s adjustment, observations, 
        and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers 
        can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
