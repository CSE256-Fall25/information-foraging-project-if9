      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <p>
        At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals 
        with their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and 
        physical development.
      </p>
      <p>
        We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, 
        play-based curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the 
        teachings of educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, 
        we create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the whole child by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the students, 
          with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language, discussion, 
          experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them
        </li>
        <li>
          Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple 
          senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning
        </li>
        <li>
          Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating 
          opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group 
          of peers
        </li>
        <li>
          Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses, 
          listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they 
          seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills
        </li>
        <li>
          Respecting students' ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students to 
          become problem solvers
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the 
          similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the 
          unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Washington University Nursery School's open curriculum framework is presented in ways 
        that are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most 
        effectively through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers 
        experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. 
        Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical 
        developmental needs of each child.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subheading">Social and Emotional Development</h2>
      <p>
        Individual children's capabilities are valued and strengthened within the group throughout 
        the curriculum:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Building self-esteem through communication, planning, responsibility, problem-solving,
          participation, following directions, imagination and sharing within the group
        </li>
        <li>
          Developing skills in collaboration, compromise, self-expression, respect for self and
          others through experience, dialogue, and problem solving
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
